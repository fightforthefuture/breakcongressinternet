    <h1>Stop the PATRIOT Act</h1>
    <h2>Blackout Congress' Internet</h2>
    <h3>&mdash; When it matters most. &mdash;</h3>
    <p>
        No one has the right to spy on our lives, and US law says so. But,
        Congress is days away from reauthorizing the Patriot Act to undermine
        the Constitution and put us under mass surveillance for years. It's now
        or never. Let's block all of Congress' IP addresses, and show them a
        message they can't ignore. This is happening soon, sign up.

    <h2>Spread the word.</h2>

    <p>
        If Congress renews the bulk collection provisions of the PATRIOT Act, it's game over for our privacy. Whether
        you're browsing the Internet, sending a text message, or buying a book, the
        government will be watching. Don't let Congress undermine the Constitution.
        Help us share this action with as many people as possible!

    <h2>What's happening?</h2>
    
    <p>Things are bad, but they're not unfixable. The US is off track, violating its founding principles by mass spying on everyone, out of choice. That is, Congress chose corruption over freedom. The NSA and defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen justified the creation of the largest surveillance system in history through a culture of fear and networking with Congress.  Since then, they've given us false security for profit, a bargain that has led to a mass surveillance system that is being abused to monitor everyone, the kind of system that is usually reserved for dictatorships. We don't have to keep letting corruption trample on our basic values.
</p>
<p>
The US Constitution says that there shall be no search and seizure without a probable cause. That's why Edward Snowden's revelations about the US' mass government surveillance of our private lives shocked the world. Since then, we learned what laws the government has abused to justify conducting these programs - the Patriot Act, the FISA Amendments Act, and Executive Order 12333. The Patriot Act was passed shortly after the 9/11 attacks, with minimal vetting and within a few days of being introduced.  The NSA exploits Section 215 of the Patriot Act to spy on all Americans, by collecting information about our phone records.  Other provisions have been used to collect information about our emails and to engage in other unjustifiable surveillance of ordinary Americans.
</p>

    <h2>Now, what?</h2>
<p>
Key Patriot Act Provisions are about to expire. On June 1st, three Patriot Act provisions need Congressional approval to be renewed — including Section 215.  Congress is considering reauthorizing it with no, or with minimal, changes and without addressing other critical surveillance programs — like warrantless wiretapping or email and other collection under Executive Order 12333 — or making the intelligence agencies more accountable. But, the Patriot Act's expiration forces Congress to consider surveillance legislation now; we can make sure these provisions' expiration is status quo and see through real surveillance reform. 
</p><p>
In order to end mass government surveillance, retiring key provisions of the Patriot Act is just the first part in the bigger effort to stop any codification of bulk collection of our records without a warrant and without accountability and transparency. If we work together, we can do just that. There are multiple bills being introduced in both the House and Senate, and the process moving forward will be complicated and frequently unpredictable more than a day or two ahead of time.  We’ll update the site to reflect key changes in the state of play and make sure that actions are targeted to have the most impact. This is the way we have won big things in the past, and we have to do the same to address surveillance this year.

                Awesome! Monopolies and governments are trying to manipulate the Internet for gain, so we're building a twitter army to defend ourselves and send out messages the world can't ignore. Using our automatic tweet tool, thousands of people broadcast urgent alerts on their twitter feeds at the same time at key moments in the fight. You can do this too &mdash; just authorize the tool on the next screen (you can quit at any time). Let's use the Internet to defend itself and our freedom to build the world around us. Click to start!
